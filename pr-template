## Why are we doing this?

Does everyone understand the problem this diff is solving? This may just be a
restatement of the ticket. Think of your audience; could someone not familiar
with the language understand? A non-technical person? Remember that this will
be preserved forever in the git history.

## Documentation

How is the change you made documented? README/Wiki/comments/Makefile ? Who
could replicate your work?

## Dangers

What possible adverse affects are there?
* Uptime
* Security
* Performance

## Followup tasks

* Was there something you postponed to keep this small but want to revisit?
* Is there an artifact that needs to be deployed by hand?
* Is there a change to Jenkins that needs to be made?
* Is there something to do out-of-band after this is landed?

## Test coverage

_(Optional)_ Increasing test coverage is important to us. If you let test
coverage slip, you have to justify it.

## Technical debt note

Do a quick estimate of if this diff increases or decreases technical debt.
Leave a message to future developers about why increased technical debt is
worth it, or brag about how you figured out how to reduce technical debt.
